I used Spotify API to build this project

### Steps to run this project in your own
1. run `npm install` in auth-server folder using terminal to install all necessary dependencies
2. run `node app.js`
3. go to [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and create an app, *because you will need a client id, secret id and redirect uri in your code to make the application worked after you log in your Spotify account*
4. go to [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
5. have fun with this project :wink:
